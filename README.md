# Project Overview

This project utilizes topic modeling to examine a corpus of ten travel writings from early American written by white women.

## Project Background

This project is inspired by my undergraduate capstone, which was focused on early American women’s travel narratives. As I enjoyed researching the topic using traditional historical research methods, I was intrigued about how digital humanities could add to the discussion. I was specifically intrigued by the concept of topic modeling and what it could bring to the analysis of travel writing. I wondered if topic modeling would reveal anything new that could not be discovered through close reading of the travel writings. Additionally, due to my previous work with early American women’s travel narratives, I hypothesized that societal values, such as women’s place in society and gentility, would appear in the topics generated through topic modeling. I was intrigued by the possibility that the American Revolution played a role in evolving societal values, which became a central aspect of the project.
