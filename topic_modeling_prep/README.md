# Preparing the Text for Topic Modeling
In this folder are the various files that document the process of preparing the travel writings to be run through MALLET and topic modeled.

### lemmatized_words
In order to properly topic model, words have to be reduced to their base form in a process called lemmatizing. This is a list of all the words that were lemmatized.

### standardized_words
As spelling was not standardized in early America, travel writings often had various spellings for the same word. In order for MALLET to properly generate topics, I had to standardize spelling across all of the travel writings. This is a list of the words that were standardized.

### stopwords
This is the list of additional stopwords I curated and utilized alongside the stopword list MALLET provides.
