journey as i trust they are convince by my past life that i would not for the universe act in opposition to what i knew they approve i am convince when you know mrs and mrs derby you will feel that i was both secure and honor in their protection i cannot tell you half i owe them never in my life was i treat with more affectionate attention they appear as much interest in all i do as if i were their daughter you know my heart my dearest mother you know it never was insensible to the smallest favor what then must be its sensation when it is thus overpower by affectionate kindness i long to convince them how much i feel but words are inadequate my father has seen mr d i wish he would write to him i think it would be no more
