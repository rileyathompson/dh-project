# The Women

Depicted here are the ten women whose travel writing make up the project corpus. Information pertaining to how they fit into the corpus, such as place of birth, and pertinent information about their travel writing, such as date of travel, is provided here. Additionally, a brief narrative biography is provided that discusses the woman and their journey in more depth.

While researching these women, I had to make various assumptions due to either contradicting or a lack of information. This does not apply to all of the women in the corpus, however, if an assumption had to be made about information pertaining to the woman, it will be discussed in the accompanying paragraph.

Sarah Kemble Knight, known as Madame Knight, was a teacher and businesswoman. At the age of 38, she set out for New Haven, Connecticut and then continued on to New York, New York in order to settle family business. Specifically, her purpose was to settle the estate of a friend’s deceased husband, after which she returned home to Boston, Massachusetts. In total, it was a gruelling five month journey that was conducted almost entirely on horseback. Particularly gruelling for Knight were the various river crossings, as she had a fear of water and drowning. This is not to say Knight had a terrible journey, she enjoyed many enjoyable social interactions, which were often had over meals in the inns she stayed at along her journey. She traveled largely unaccompanied and hired guides throughout her journey. Her travel narrative is witty and extremely detailed, reflecting Knight’s own personality. Knight’s travel narrative is one of the first documentations of travel in early America made by a woman.

Esther Edwards Burr kept a personal diary where she documented her day to day life, which includes her journey from Stockbridge, Massachusetts to Newark, New Jersey at 24 years of age. She had been in Stockbridge visiting family for an extended period of time and had decided it was time to return home to Newark. The trip home was a ten-day journey that involved passing through New York, New York. Throughout her journey, she was forced to travel with a group of Dutchmen and repeatedly expressed great displeasure about it. While her journey home was a ten-day journey, she doesn’t document the final day of the journey until days later. This is because her young son fell deathly ill on the journey from New York to Newark, and the illness was so bad that the doctor was not sure the child would survive.

Elizabeth Sandwith Drinker was a Quaker woman who kept a diary between the years of 1758 and 1807. In her diary, she documents a 15-day tour of the Pennsylvania countryside that she embarked upon at 36 years of age. She traveled with a group and visited various places such as Lancaster and the top of one of the “Oley Hills.” While on her journey, there was an incident where the horse pulling the wagon stumbled, which resulted in Drinker injuring her foot. There is contradicting information regarding Drinker’s birth year. Some sources provide an exact birth date, however, the majority of academic sources provide only a birth year, which is what I’ve decided to abide by.

She departed in December and arrived in Pittsburgh in January. She stayed in Pittsburgh until May, waiting out the winter and for a ship to take her up the Mississippi River. The remnants of the American Revolution are visible through her journal, as she remarks on various military forts, prominent war locations, and the effect the war had on settlements along the Mississippi. The first two pages of her travel journal are missing and lost to history. As such, the exact starting date of her journey is unknown.

She was 19 when she embarked on this journey and was invited on the journey by an older couple who she conveys treated her as their own child. She is the youngest woman in this corpus, which is reflected through her wonder at everything she encounters on her journey. While she enjoys her journey, she frequently expresses missing her family, which is only compounded by the fact that she embarked on the journey without permission from her parents. The exact start date of her journey is unknown, as she does not state the date in the letter or the letter heading. When she was born, Scarborough was part of the state of Massachusetts; however, Scarborough is now a part of the state of Maine.
