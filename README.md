# Project Overview

This project utilizes topic modeling to examine a corpus of ten travel writings from early American written by white women.

## Project Questions

- Can topic modeling identify societal values in early American women’s travel writing?
- If topic modeling can identify societal values in early American women’s travel writing, what societal values appear?
- Did the American Revolution lead to a change in American societal values?

For the purposes of this project, I am defining societal values as widely held beliefs that shape perceptions and behavior. This includes beliefs about class and gender, which were the societal beliefs I expected to encounter at the beginning of this project. However, societal values are incredibly nuanced and can vary from place to place. Therefore, I’m attempting to identify broad topics that could be the basis for further research rather than ultra-specific values.

## Project Background

This project is inspired by my undergraduate capstone, which was focused on early American women’s travel narratives. As I enjoyed researching the topic using traditional historical research methods, I was intrigued about how digital humanities could add to the discussion. I was specifically intrigued by the concept of topic modeling and what it could bring to the analysis of travel writing. I wondered if topic modeling would reveal anything new that could not be discovered through close reading of the travel writings. Additionally, due to my previous work with early American women’s travel narratives, I hypothesized that societal values, such as women’s place in society and gentility, would appear in the topics generated through topic modeling. I was intrigued by the possibility that the American Revolution played a role in evolving societal values, which became a central aspect of the project. My hypothesis is that the American Revolution led to an uptick in liberty and patriotism in the post-revolution travel writings.
