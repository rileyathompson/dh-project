# Corpus Building

The first step of the project was building a corpus. First, what counts as travel writing had to be defined. For this project, the documentation of travel via travel narratives, letters, and diaries counts as travel writing. Next was the archival research, which was directed by the following set of requirements:

- Written by a woman who was born and raised in the American Colonies
- A record of travel that occurred within British Colonial America/the United States
- Written before 1812
- An account of voluntary travel

As the project is concerned with the societal values of white, colonial American women, it was decided the author needed to be raised in America in order to reflect such values. Additionally, in order to prevent the significant presence of non-American societal values in the project, travel was contained within the U.S. This project is mainly interested in early American culture and society, and 1812 was selected as the cutoff point for early America. This is because the War of 1812 took place in 1812 and was a unifying, nation-building identity event as it was the first international conflict the United States was involved in that was not centered on Native American conflict. Captivity narratives were excluded from this project, as I was more interested in exploring casual depictions of societal values rather than the extreme societal values that typically appear in captivity narratives.

  After extensive research, a corpus of ten different women’s travel writings was created. Five were written before the American Revolution and five were written after the American Revolution. Eight out of ten narratives are pulled from the Alexander Street: North American Women’s Letters and Diaries database, with the addition of Hannah Callender Sanson’s and Elizabeth House Trist’s travel writings that are not from the database.
