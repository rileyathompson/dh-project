come in a great while speechless and sometimes dont say a word til they are ask what they want which i impute to the awe they stand in of the merchant who they are constant almost indebt too and must take what they bring without liberty to choose for themselves but they serve them as well make the merchant stay long enough for their pay we may observe here the great necessity and benefit both of education and conversation for these people have as large a portion of mother wit and sometimes a large than those who have been bring up in city but for want of improvement render themselves almost ridiculous as above i should be glad if they would leave such folly and am sure all that love clean house at least would be glad on t too they are generally very plain in their dress throughout
