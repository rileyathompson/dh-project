# Historical Context

## Women’s Lives in Early America

In early America, women’s lives mainly revolved around the home. They were expected to be mothers and housewives, and as such, were largely confined to the domestic sphere. They performed labor, had social interactions, and more, all within the walls of their home. Largely, their only life outside of the home was at church, which provided women a brief respite from the demands of the home while also simultaneously imposing additional expectations. This is not to say that women were without agency in early America. They frequently sought out and formed communities and built social networks that contributed to the labor they performed, their religious practices, and more.

## Travel in Early America

Travel in early America was largely a male endeavor due to the difficulty of traveling and the societal gender expectations of the period. In the eighteenth century, travel was mainly done on horseback as the roads were either not well kept or there were no roads that existed. Due to the difficulty of traveling, journeys were often taken over short distances; however, as travel conditions improved, so did the length of the journeys. As the century progressed and trade increased, travel conditions improved out of necessity. Wagons, carriages, and stagecoaches began to be used more as roads improved. Additionally, water travel grew in popularity alongside improvements to ship technology. 

In terms of lodging, public houses, such as inns and taverns, were located all along travel routes. This is primarily where travelers would stay, although camping outside was not outside of the norm. Public houses were more common along the eastern seaboard and were more sparse in the western areas of the colonies.

Traveling for women provided a unique opportunity for them to escape the more rigid gender roles they were expected to abide by. The gruelling demands and dangers associated with travel provided women with leeway they were not often provided. This is not to say that societal gender expectations evaporated while traveling, they were simply lessened. Additionally, traveling meant women were outside of the home and the responsibilities associated with the home, which also freed women of various gender expectations.
