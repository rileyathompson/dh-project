we are now on penne pack bridge you will say i am but a poor travel when i tell you it is the best bridge i ever went over although it has but three arch i wish it was in my power to describe the beauty of this place stop and look at it on the left side you see the water tumble down the rock froth and sparkle as it go at the bottom it run ripple over stone and then through the bridge where it soon seemsto forget its late rapid and gentle murmur on the creek is not very wide so that the tree on each side may almost shake hand and what add much to the beauty of the whole are the shrub and bush all in blossom along the bank but it won t do to stay here all day we must leave it to
